# E-commerce Customer Analytics Project

This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on understanding customer behavior, product performance, and time-based order trends for an e-commerce platform using Python, SQL, and Tableau.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project includes customer order data, product details, and departmental information. It was provided as a CSV file, which was processed, cleaned, and analyzed.

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Python**
- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **Tableau**

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Ecommerce.sql` – All SQL queries used for analysis
- `Ecommerce Analysis.py` – Python code for EDA and ML
- `Ecommerce dataset Portfolio.twbx` – Tableau workbook with all dashboards
- `dashboard_screenshots` – PNG snapshots of the Tableau dashboards
- `pythonplots` - PNG snapshots of the python visualizations

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Used SQL (20+ queries) for behavioral insights like reorder trends, cart size, time-based patterns, churn risk, etc.
- Performed data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning (reorder prediction) using Python.
- Created 5 interactive Tableau dashboards using visualized datasets.

## 🧠 Skills Used

- SQL: Joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregations
- Python: Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Tableau: Charts, filters, calculated fields, dashboard design

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Identified high-risk churn users with extended order gaps
- Identified key customer segments based on order frequency
- Popular product pairs revealed cross-sell opportunities
- Time-of-day and day-of-week trends aligned with marketing windows
- Departments with low reorder rates identified for product strategy review
- Gained deeper understanding of the first vs repeat purchase behavior

## Python Analysis and Visualizations

- **ROC Curve**:Evaluated machine learning model performance (see below)
- **Elbow Method**: Determined the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation (see below)
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Showed correlations between various product and customer features (see below)

These plots can be found in the `pythonplots` folder in this repository.
