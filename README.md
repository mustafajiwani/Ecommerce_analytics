# E-commerce Customer Analytics Project

This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on understanding customer behavior, product performance, and time-based order trends for an e-commerce platform using Python, SQL, and Tableau.

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Python**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualizations, Machine Learning
- **SQL (MySQL)**: Complex queries for user segmentation, reorder patterns, product affinity, and time-based trends
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for business insights

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project includes customer order data, product details, and departmental information. It was provided as a CSV file, which was processed, cleaned, and analyzed.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Ecommerce.sql` – All SQL queries used for analysis
- `Ecommerce_Analysis.py` – Python code for EDA and ML
- `Ecommerce dataset Portfolio.twbx` – Tableau workbook with all dashboards
- `dashboard_screenshots/` – PNG snapshots of the Tableau dashboards

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Identified high-risk churn users with extended order gaps
- Identified key customer segments based on order frequency
- Popular product pairs revealed cross-sell opportunities
- Time-of-day and day-of-week trends aligned with marketing windows
- Departments with low reorder rates identified for product strategy review
- Gained deeper understanding of the first vs repeat purchase behavior

## Python Analysis and Visualizations

- **ROC Curve**:Evaluated machine learning model performance (see image below)
- **Elbow Method**: Determined the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation (see image below)
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Showed correlations between various product and customer features
